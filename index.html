      <p class="how-to--text">
        On a turn, a player rolls the dice ðŸŽ² repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up (hold) the numbers rolled on
        the dice ðŸŽ². However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited.
        Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during that particular roll. A player has to choose
        to hold (stop rolling the dice ðŸŽ²) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn. If the
        player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score. When a player reaches a total of 100 points,
        the game ends and that player is the winner.
